Analytics and the eye test. The award for Most Valuable Player in Major League Baseball is no different but, in a day, and age of analytics and money ball the MVP still seems to be decided more on the eye test and the big names versus who is actually the Most Valuable Player in the league.\nThis was very evident in 2024’s American League MVP race between Bobby Witt Jr. and Aaron Judge, but first a breakdown of the stats.\nRuns Above Position or Rpos is a statistic that represents how many more runs a player is worth at their position compared to a replacement-level player at the same position. Essentially, it accounts for the inherent value or difficulty of playing a particular defensive position.\nRbat (WAR Runs Batting) is a statistic for each position player, this number represents the number of runs above or below average a hitter is.\nWins above Replacement is a statistic that estimates how many more wins a player contributes to their team compared to a hypothetical “replacement level” player at the same position.
