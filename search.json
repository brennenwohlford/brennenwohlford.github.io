    "text": "Most Valuable Player awards are some of the most contentious awards in all of sports. Voters base their decisions off a multitude of things, but they all boil down to two main things. Analytics and the eye test. The award for Most Valuable Player in Major League Baseball is no different but, in a day, and age of analytics and money ball the MVP still seems to be decided more on the eye test and the big names versus who is actually the Most Valuable Player in the league.\nThis was very evident in 2024’s American League MVP race between Bobby Witt Jr. and Aaron Judge, but first a breakdown of the stats.\nRuns Above Position or Rpos is a statistic that represents how many more runs a player is worth at their position compared to a replacement-level player at the same position. Essentially, it accounts for the inherent value or difficulty of playing a particular defensive position.\nRbat (WAR Runs Batting) is a statistic for each position player, this number represents the number of runs above or below average a hitter is.\nWins above Replacement is a statistic that estimates how many more wins a player contributes to their team compared to a hypothetical “replacement level” player at the same position. Essentially, it quantifies a player’s overall value in terms of wins, considering both their offensive and defensive contributions.\nIn this first chart all of these statistics are used to compare Bobby Witt Jr., Aaron Judge, and the last 10 AL MVPs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_2009_2024.csv\")\n\nmvps &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"MVP\", Awards) == TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(MVP = str_extract(Awards, \"MVP-\\\\d+\")) |&gt;\n  separate(MVP, into=c(\"MVP\", \"Place\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Place = as.numeric(Place)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  filter(Place == \"1\" | Place == \"2\") |&gt;\n  filter(season == \"2015\" | season == \"2016\" | season == \"2017\" | season == \"2018\" | season == \"2019\" |season == \"2020\" | season == \"2021\" | season == \"2022\" | season == \"2023\" | season == \"2024\")\n\nal &lt;- mvps |&gt;\n  filter(Lg == \"AL\")\n\nnl &lt;- mvps |&gt;\n  filter(Lg == \"NL\")\n\nwinners &lt;- al |&gt;\n  filter(Place == \"1\")\n\nbwj &lt;- al |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\")\n\njudge &lt;- al|&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Aaron Judge\")\n\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=mvps,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, size=Rbat),\n     color=\"grey\",\n    alpha=.3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=winners,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, size=Rbat),\n    color=\"red\") +\n   geom_point(\n    data=bwj,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, size=Rbat),\n    color=\"#BD9B60\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=judge,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, size=Rbat),\n    color=\"#003087\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.4675) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = -2.475) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=winners,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, label=Player)) +\n      geom_text_repel(\n    data=bwj,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=Rpos, label=Player)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins Above Replacement\",\n    y=\"Runs above Position\",\n    title=\"There's more to Baseball than WAR\",\n    subtitle=\"Bobby Witt Jr. was 10 runs above his position and almost finished evenly with Judge in WAR.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Brennen Wohlford\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositional data does well to show how valuable a player is compared to their colleagues. This next chart will dive deeper into Offensive WAR versus Defensive WAR. Offense is fun but only having offense does not make a complete player let alone a Most Valuable Player in the league. Aaron Judge has been one of the best players in the league for a long time offensively with an average defense. Last year that took a major step backwards with a -0.9 Defensive War while Bobby Witt Jr. had a 1.2 Defensive War. Defense matters.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggnewscale)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_2009_2024.csv\") \n  \nmvps &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(grepl(\"MVP\", Awards) == TRUE) |&gt;\n  mutate(MVP = str_extract(Awards, \"MVP-\\\\d+\")) |&gt;\n  separate(MVP, into=c(\"MVP\", \"Place\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Place = as.numeric(Place)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Player)) |&gt;\n  filter(Place == \"1\" | Place == \"2\") |&gt;\n  filter(season == \"2015\" | season == \"2016\" | season == \"2017\" | season == \"2018\" | season == \"2019\" |season == \"2020\" | season == \"2021\" | season == \"2022\" | season == \"2023\" | season == \"2024\")\n\nmvpshort &lt;- mvps |&gt;\n  group_by(season, Player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totalowar = sum(oWAR),\n    totaldwar = sum(dWAR)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player, season)) \n\nmvpslong &lt;- mvpshort |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"total\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"WAR\") \n\nbwj &lt;- mvpslong |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Bobby Witt Jr.\")\n\njudge &lt;- mvpslong |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Aaron Judge\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=mvpslong, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, WAR), weight=WAR, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"lightgrey\", \"darkgrey\")) +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_bar(data=bwj, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, WAR), weight=WAR, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#004687\", \"#BD9B60\")) +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_bar(data=judge, aes(x=reorder(PlayerSeason, WAR), weight=WAR, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#E4002C\", \"#003087\")) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Player\",\n    y=\"Total WAR\",\n    title=\"Defense matters in Baseball\",\n    subtitle=\"Bobby Witt Jr. not only had a 9.2 Offensive WAR but he also had a 1.2 Defensive WAR\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | Brennen Wohlford\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last chart compares the overall WAR from the Royals and Yankees last year. How each team compares in WAR will help to determine who was truly more valuable to their team. From adding together each teams total WAR the Royals had 20.4 Wins above replacement while the Yankees had 30 Wins above Replacement. Who is more valuable to their team, the player who accounted for nearly half of his team’s WAR or the player who accounted for only a third of his team’s WAR.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nplayers &lt;- read_csv(\"mlb_hitter_value_2009_2024.csv\")\n\nmlb &lt;- players |&gt;\n  filter(\n    season == \"2024\") |&gt;\n  filter(PA &gt; 230)\n\ngoodmlb &lt;- mlb |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Player)) |&gt; mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Player))\n\nroyals &lt;- goodmlb |&gt;\n  filter( Team == \"KCR\")\n\nyankees &lt;- goodmlb |&gt;\n   filter( Team == \"NYY\")\n\nRoyalsYankees &lt;- goodmlb |&gt;\n  filter( Team == \"NYY\" | Team == \"KCR\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=goodmlb, aes(x=WAR, y=oWAR), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=royals, aes(x=WAR, y=oWAR), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=yankees, aes(x=WAR, y=oWAR), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1.68973, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1.68973, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=RoyalsYankees,\n    aes(x=WAR, y=oWAR, label = Player)\n  ) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Total Wins Above Replacement\",\n    y=\"Offensive Wins Above Replacement\",\n    title=\"The Yankees overall team is better than the Royals\",\n    subtitle=\"Bobby Witt Jr. is more valuable to his team than Aaron Judge is because the average WAR of the Yankees is higher than the Royals\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By Brennen Wohlford\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Valuable Player votes will always be controversial to some fans, but this data has hopefully helped to clear things up around the discussions and give you new insight for the next vote."
